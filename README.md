How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

The best possible approach you can have to make sure your software, code and program are functional would be testing them. Testing is extremely important to the overall integrity of the project, it will tell you what you need to fix and how to fix it. One problem with testing is developers sometimeshave a hard time accepting they are the one making the mistake and not the code so putting your ego to the side is majorly important when it comes to the software development process. While testing can be tedious and sometimes costly it is the absolute best way to make sure you have a functioning product that is ready to released to users.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

User needs can be a tricky thing to understand because sometimes the user doesn't even know what they need directly. If you are given program requirements the best thing to do would be follow along with those and then try to talk to as many users as possible during the development process to see what you could add or remove in order to better the user experience. Having a user test run on your program and then taking their feedback and incorporating can be the difference between a majorly successful project and one that falls through.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software as if it was a puzzle. Things are put together piece by piece to give us a beautiful finished product in the end. Each step has its importance and leads to the nect step that is taken. Keeping user requirements in mind if any are very important because that gives you the base of where to start your work and then you can build off that in order to round out your software. Making sure that you and client are seeing eye to eye on the vusion of the program will make for a much easier development schedule then being on two completely different pages. With these things in mind, the path to a successful design for software should be much easier.
